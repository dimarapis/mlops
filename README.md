Repo developed for exercise section of course 02476 Machine Learning Operations
==============================
# Updated January 2023 @ the Technical University of Denmark
## Clone repo
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/dimarapis/mlops
```
## Installation
Generate an environment for *conda* or *venv*:
```shell
$ make create_environment
```
After activating this environment, install the requirements:
```shell
$ make requirements
```
Ensure project is installed as package:
```shell
$ pip install e .
```

## Exercises
## Day 1:
#### Build a simple model and a simple training loop

Train the model and visualize loss
```shell
$ python exercises/day_1/main.py train --lr 1e-2
```
See results: [Link to file](reports/figures/training_loss.png)

Evaluate model until achieving >85% accuracy
```shell
$ python exercises/day_1/main.py evaluate models/day1_best.pth
```
## Day 2:
#### Transform to cookiecutter format and run day1 exercises

Prepare data (as tensors)
```shell
$ make data
```

Train the model and visualize loss
```shell
$ make train
```

Evaluate model until achieving >85% accuracy - not with makefile
```shell
$ python src/models/predict_model.py models/day2_best.pth data/processed/test.pt
```

Visualize features
```shell
$ python src/visualization/visualize.py
```
See results [Link to file](reports/figures/visualize.png)

Check that code is pep8 compliant
```shell
$ flake8 .
```

Fix errors with black and manually
```shell
$ black .
```

Fix typing exercise and test if type compliant
```shell
$ mypy exercises/typing_exercise.py
```

## Day 3:
#### Build dockers and config files
Training docker build
```shell
$ docker build -f trainer.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest
```
Run training in docker
```shell
$ docker run --name training trainer:latest
```

Create a config file with training parameters
<br/>
See: [Link to file](src/configs/config.yaml)

## Day 9:
### Distributed data loading

Plot data loading process using different amount of threads.
```shell
python lfw_dataset.py -get_timing
```
